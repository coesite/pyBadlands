    "To handle depression in this version of **Badlands** (v 2.0.) we use a modified version of Planchon & Darboux depression-filling algorithm. In this approach the time step is automatically adjust in order to ensure stability and to prevent formation of depositional mount. The method consists in filling depressions with lakes of user-imposed maximum depth (parameter **fillmax**) and simulating the filling of the lake as an iterative process.\n",
