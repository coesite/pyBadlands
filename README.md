_A schematic of 2D landscape evolution model illustrating the main variables and forces simulated with Badlands: z is the surface elevation, r refers to rainfall, sl to sea-level fluctuations, f to the flexural isostasy and u to geodynamic forces (from [**Salles & Hardiman, 2016**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2016.03.011))._

## Overview

**Ba**sin an**d** **Lan**dscape **D**ynamic**s** (**Badlands**) is a parallel TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography development at various space and time scales. The model is capable of simulating hillslope processes (**linear** & **non-linear** diffusion), fluvial incision (*'modified'* **Stream Power Law**, **Transport Capacity Law** both for sediment  erosion/transport/deposition), spatially and temporally varying geodynamic (horizontal + vertical displacements) and climatic forces which can be used to simulate changes in base level, as well as effects of climate changes or sea-level fluctuations. The model uses  [**gFlex**](https://github.com/awickert/gFlex) package which is designed to solve elastic plate flexure for applications to Earth's lithosphere.

## Getting started

For installation information and documentation visit our github [**wiki page**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands/wiki) which provides several useful notes on how to start using the tool.

The easiest way to get started is with the [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/u/badlandsmodel/) using [Kitematic](https://docs.docker.com/kitematic/userguide/). Once **Kitematic** is installed on your computer, open it and look for **pybadlands-demo** via the *search* menu.

If you want to install it yourself, these 2 Dockerfiles ([**dependencies**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands-Dependencies-Docker/blob/master/Dockerfile) & [**code**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands-Docker-Demo/blob/master/Dockerfile)) are the best documentation of the required packages.

The latest pyBadlands version is the one that’s in our Github [repository](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands). Get it using this shell command, which requires Git:
* `git clone https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands.git`

## The specs...

The model is based on the following characteristics:
* The finite volume approach from [**Tucker et al. (2001)**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300400001345) based on the dual Delaunay-Voronoi framework is used to solve the continuity equation explicitly,
* Node ordering is perform efficiently based on the work from [**Braun & Willett (2013)**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X12004618),
* 3D surface deformations using the node refinement technique proposed by [**Thieulot et al. ( 2014)**](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GC005490/abstract;jsessionid=48A885F79A40B1E3E76AFC1BEAA2B238.f03t03).
* Orographic precipitation using [**Smith & Barstad (2004)**](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469(2004)061%3C1377%3AALTOOP%3E2.0.CO%3B2) linear model to compute topographic induced rain field.
* Varying erodibility layers (both horizontally and vertically) to simulate impact of changing sediment characteristics on landscape evolution. 

A set of functions for _pre_ & _post_-processing of **Badlands** inputs and outputs is available in a GitHub [**Companion**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands-Companion) repository which is already shipped with the Badlands Docker container.
